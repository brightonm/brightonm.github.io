# Differential Machine Learning

{:toc}

Supervised learning method
Benchmark against analytical supervised
Applied on MC
PyTorch implementation

=> conclusion quality of derivatives, cannot learned on MC computed sensitivies
are needed see Savine AAD derivatives


Notebooks


### Differential machine learning

### Applications

### Benchmark again 

```python
import torch
torch.__version__
```
