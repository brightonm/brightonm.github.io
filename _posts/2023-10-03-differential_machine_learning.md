## Supervised Learning

Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ be a dataset of inputs with $n$ samples and $d$ features, and let $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ represent the corresponding labels. In the context of pricing a financial derivative, $X$ contains information about the derivative's payoff, such as the strike price, and the model used to compute the price, along with market data like spot prices and interest rates. $y$ represents the corresponding prices. Depending on the pricing model and payoff structure, these prices can be generated either analytically or through computationally expensive numerical methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations. The pricing function, denoted as $f$, maps $X$ to $y$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
  f: \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} &\to \mathbb{R}^{n}\\
  X &\mapsto y
\end{align*}
$$

The idea is to approximate the pricing function $f$ by employing a neural network denoted as $f_{\theta}$, where $\theta$ represents its weights and biases. Inference with a neural network is fast and amenable to batching. Therefore, in situations where traditional pricing methods prove to be slow, the neural network approximation can serve as a promising alternative.

To closely replicate the pricer $f$, the neural network must be trained on $(X=(x_1, \dots, x_n), y)$. his is accomplished by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function:

$$
\theta^* = \min_{\theta} J(\theta) = \min_{\theta} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n}(y_i - f_{\theta}(x_i))^2
$$

Various numerical algorithms based on mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, such as Adam (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #111">Kingma et al., 2014</a>), can be employed to solve this optimization problem. These algorithms are typically implemented in deep learning libraries like PyTorch, JAX or TensorFlow, that leverage Automatic Adjoint Differentiation (AAD) to efficiently compute the quantity $\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta}$ (<a href=" https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJJsrmfCZ" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #111">Paszke et al., 2017</a>).

## Supervised Learning with differentials

*Unlike the article, I'm adopting an offline learning approach here. I'll be employing differential machine learning by training on ground truth prices instead of noisy sampled payoffs, as seen in the article. Differential deep learning can also be beneficial in this context. While the data generation phase and training can be expensive, the neural network is trained just once on a predefined domain of market data.*

### Training with Derivatives

#### Differential labels

In the field of quantitative finance, assessing price sensitivities to market data, commonly referred to as "the Greeks", is crucial for effective hedging and robust risk management. Differential machine learning leverages these sensitivities by incorporating them into the training process of supervised learning techniques. This approach involves working with augmented datasets that include differentials of labels with respect to inputs, denoted as 

$$
Z = \frac{\partial y}{\partial X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\\
$$

Each element $Z_{ij}$ in the matrix corresponds to the partial derivative of the $i$-th sample of the vector $y$ with respect to the $i$ sample and $j$-th feature of the dataset $X$.
This can be expressed as:

$$
Z_{ij} = \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial X_{ij}}
$$

 The derivation of these differentials, which depends on the specific model and payoff structure, can be accomplished through various methods, including analytical calculations, numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, or the application of Automatic Adjoint Differentiation (AAD). (<a href="https://books.google.fr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=eZZxDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&ots=VT7YWs35Du&sig=L9sgoh4lEZJYwghXWFbuIcauG4w&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #111">Savine, 2018</a>).

#### Differential predictions

  <figcaption>Fig. 2. Twin network. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02347" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;">Savine et al., 2020</a>)</figcaption>

They introduce a twin network to demonstrate that, just as we can compute derivatives of outputs with respect to weights, we can also calculate the derivatives of outputs with respect to inputs using the same technique, known as AAD. Under the hood, every deep learning library employs this method to propagate gradients during backpropagation.

In essence, this is accomplished by recording the computation graph during the forward pass. As a result, for each variable, whether it's an input, weight, or bias of the neural network there exists a computational path of simple operations leading from them to the resulting outputs. Each node along these paths contains information about the forward operation itself and its corresponding inverse operation required for gradient backpropagation .

Hence, we can obtain the derivative of any variables 'b' situated within a node of the graph concerning any other node of the graph that contains variable 'a,' as long as 'b' is positioned ahead of 'a' in the computational graph. This capability enables us to compute the derivatives of the outputs with respect to the inputs of the neural network.

In PyTorch, to begin dynamically tracking the computation graph, we need to set the `requires_grad` attribute of the variable for which we want to compute derivatives. In this context, the inputs require this attribute to be set to `True`. The weights and biases, on the other hand, have this attribute set to True by default. Subsequently, to perform backpropagation through the graph up to a specific node, you only need a single line of PyTorch code, as demonstrated in the example below using `torch.autograd` (<a href=" https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJJsrmfCZ" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #111">Paszke et al., 2017</a>).

#### New loss function

Now that we have both the true differential labels and their approximations produced by the neural network, we can penalize the approximation errors using the same metric (MSE) that we used for penalizing errors in values:

$$
\begin{align*}
MSE_{value}(\theta) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n}\left(y_i - f_{\theta}(x_i)\right)^2 \\
MSE_{differentials}(\theta) &= \frac{1}{n \times m} \sum_{j=0}^{m}\sum_{i=0}^{n}\left(Z_{ij} - \frac{\partial f_{\theta}(X)}{\partial X}_{ij}\right)^2
\end{align*}
$$

These two losses can be combined in a convex manner by introducing an additional hyperparameter, denoted as $\alpha$, which controls how much we want to penalize the derivatives. By default, we set $\alpha$ to $\frac{1}{m+1}$, where $m$ represents the number of features with respect to which derivatives are calculated. This choice considers one error in the price to be as important as an error in one of the Greeks.

$$
J(\theta) = \alpha \times MSE_{value}(\theta) + (1-\alpha) \times MSE_{differentials}(\theta)
$$

TODO : parler de la normalization 

When training with Monte-Carlo paths using pathwise derivatives as differential labels (as in the article), this additional term can be regarded as a form of regularization, akin to Tikhonov or Lasso regularization. It helps in avoiding the overfitting that can occur when fitting noisy samples.

## Application on Black-Scholes Example

Unlike the article, we propose a simple example that does not use pathwise derivatives, which is the approximation of the price of a European call under Black-Scholes diffusion.
